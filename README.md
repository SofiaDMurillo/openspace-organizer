# Overview

The Openspace organizer tool was created to assign people to tables in a way that maximizes seating combinations and ensures everybody has the chance to meet and connect with each other.

Version 1.0 of the tool, this version, will assign people to tables randomly. Later on, the tool will allow some pre-conditions such as allowing people who are working on a joint project to sit together.

The tool was developed in Python 3.12.3
